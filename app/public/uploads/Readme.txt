Winabler is a drag-and-drop object enabler with standard Windows® menu object capture ability.

Have you ever been evaluating software and discovered a feature you wanted to try was disabled or "grayed out"? Well, Winabler will usually enable the feature regardless of the software's intentions. It particularly comes in handy when a program contains features that are crippled by disabling buttons, drop-down boxes or the like and you want to fully evaluate the "crippleware" prior to possibly purchasing it.

Winabler is Freeware. Keep it in your favorite toolbox for that time you really need it. 

The owner of Winabler is the author, Kerry B. Rogers. Selling or reselling Winabler is strictly prohibited. You do not have permission to include Winabler in distributed packages of software--free or not, without express written consent of the author. You may, however, give this file (WinablerSetup.exe) to anyone you wish provided it is not modified in any way. Modification restriction does not extend to file date/time stamps of WinablerSetup.exe as these can be inadverdantly modified by a given storage medium or operating system.

Winabler is copyrighted by the author and may not be used for monetary gain by anyone. It is NOT provided for the elimination of any obligation to pay for any software. It is NOT intended for piracy gains. It was created for enhanced evaluation of software that has been crippled against full feature evaluation.

The author accepts absolutely NO responsibility for consequences arising from Winabler's use or misuse--by anyone. Installation or use of Winabler constitutes your complete acceptance of liability.
